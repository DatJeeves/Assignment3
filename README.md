I used the following reference in order to learn how to expand the array. If found the following website that showed me how to do this:

I also searched the Microsoft Doc Help in VisualStudio in how to throw exceptions and how to catch them. There is one thing that I dont fully understand is why the throwing of exceptions sometimes is thrown as a const char** and some times as a sring. The code to me looked the same but the catch had to be tailored to avoid run time errors. I have them both in my catch and a default catch all. Throwing and catching exception is something I need to learn more on.
